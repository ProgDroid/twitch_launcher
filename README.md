# Twitch Launcher

CLI Twitch browser/launcher to be used with streamlink and Chatterino.

![example run](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18398887/183257473-80f9c9ec-2b72-4814-8f69-93cfb1772537.gif)

Currently only opens the stream with [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) and the chat with [Chatterino](https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2) (or [Chatterino7](https://github.com/SevenTV/chatterino7)).

## Set Up

Copy `account.json.dist` into `account.json`, fill in username and user ID. You can find your user ID [here](https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/convert-twitch-username-to-user-id/).

You will need a Twitch app Client ID and Client Secret. When running the app for the first time, you will be prompted for these.

Paste each of them as prompted, which will open a page on your browser to get the required tokens from Twitch. You might need to confirm the action.

Once this is done, you will be logged in and ready to use the app.
